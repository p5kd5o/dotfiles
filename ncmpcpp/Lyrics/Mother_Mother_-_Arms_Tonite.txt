I fell in your arms tonight
I fell hard in your arms tonight
It was nice

I died in your arms tonight
I slipped through into the afterlife
It was nice

White light in your arms tonight
I lost sight in your arms tonight
It was nice

And hey, you
Don't you think it's kinda cute
That I died
Right inside your arms tonight
That I'm fine
Even after I have died
Because it was in your arms I died

I cry
In the afterlife
I cry hard
Because I have died
And you're alive

I try
To escape afterlife
But I try hard
To get back inside
Your arms alive

And hey, you
Don't you think it's kinda cute
That I tried
To escape the afterlife
That I tried
To get back in your arms alive
That I died in your arms that

I fell hard
In your arms
And I went and died
In your arms that night

I fell in your arms tonight
Suicide in your arms

And hey, you
Don't you think it's kinda cute
That I died
Right inside your arms tonight

That I'm fine
Even after I have died
That I tried
To escape the afterlife
That I tried
To get back in your arms alive
That I died in your arms that night

I fell in your arms tonight
I died in your arms tonight
White light in your arms tonight
I fell in your arms tonight
