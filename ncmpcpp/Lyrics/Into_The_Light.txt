Into the line
I see it fine
Into the line
Our hearts entwine
Remember when
Your time again
Remember when
Your time again

Standing in the light
Always sitting on the line
Never on a side
Always wanting to be right
Standing in the light
I never wanted to be right
Now I'm attracted by the light
And blinded by the sight
Into the light...

Into the light
I see it fight
Into the light
A new horizon
Bleached into white
Kept out of sight
Bleached into white
Kept out of sight

Standing in the light
Always sitting on the line
Never on a side
Pushing out the light
Standing in the light
I never wanted to be right
Now I'm attracted by the light
And blinded by the sight
Into the light'

Dead ahead in the night
Burning in the light
And knowing that it's right
Driving in the night...

Into the light...
