from distant star
to this here bar
the me, the you
where are we now?
horray the blues
of everyone
allison

keeps a smile
around a while
he took no fright
and jettisoned
we'll go tonight
to hear him tell
"oh well"
allison
allison

and when the planet hit the sun
i saw the face of allison
allison
allison
