In the dark, (we) come out and play
We are its children, (and we're) here to stay
Running through, hungry for stray
No invita(tion, ta)ke me away
I'm not cruel,( but that's st)ill what you see
Club to club, (come see the ci)ty with me
Hungry for life, (without) your pity
I don't want (sex, but) you give it

You still can't say she won't start up
You still can't say she won't start a fight
You go the city
Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait

In the dark(ness a) killer await
To kill a life (and the) life you make
You do another, (so this) death can live
Just keep on danc(ing to the) movie you're in (I'm not cruel)
The smell of your sweat (just) lures me in
Your heart(beat does) things to me
Running feet (beats) through my blood
My ghost inside you soon will be

You still can't say she won't start up
You still can't say she won't start a fight
You go the city
Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait

Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitate your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitate your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitate your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitate your pity

Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitate your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitate your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitate your pity
Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitate your pity

I don't want sex, but you give it

You still can't say she won't start up
You still can't say she won't start a fight
You go the city
Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait

You still can't say she won't start up
You still can't say she won't start a fight
You go the city
Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait

Now it's over, you've taken your life
(The) dark grows thin, and (I'm) left to hide
I don't regret it, but it's sad anyway
Now were both dead, and so scared of the black

This life of games and diligent trust
(It's) the things we do and the things we must
I'm now tired of being cussed
So go sleep forever, end to dust
