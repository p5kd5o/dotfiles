I find you in the morning
After dreams of distant signs
You pour yourself over me
Like the sun through the blinds

You lift me up and get me out
Keep me walking but never shout
Hold the secret close
I hear you say

You know the way it throws about
It takes you in and spits you out
It spits you out when you desire
To conquer it, to feel you're higher

To follow it, you must be clean
With mistakes that you do mean
Move the heart, switch the pace
Look for what seems out of place

On and on it goes
Calling like a distant wind
Through the zero hour, we'll walk
We'll cut the thick and break the thin

No sound to break, no moment clear
When all the doubts are crystal clear
Crashing hard into the secret wind

You know the way it twists and turns
Changing colours, spinning yarns
You know the way it leaves you dry
It cuts you up and takes you high

You know the way it's painted gold
Is it honey, is it cold
You know the way it throws about
It takes you in and spits you out

Oh, cuts you up
Oh, cuts you up
Oh, cuts you up
Oh, la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

Oh oh oh oh ah, oh oh oh

You know the way it throws about
It takes you in and spits you out
It spits you out when you desire
To conquer it, to feel you're higher

To follow it, you must be clean
With mistakes that you do mean
Move the heart, switch the pace
Look for what seems out of place

Oh, cuts you up
Oh, cuts you up

It's okay, it goes this way
The line it twists, it twists away
It cuts you up and spits you out
Keeps you walking, but never shout

It's okay, it goes this way
The line it twists, it twists away
It cuts you up and spits you out
Keeps you walking, but never shout

Oh, la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Oh, ah ah ah
Oh
