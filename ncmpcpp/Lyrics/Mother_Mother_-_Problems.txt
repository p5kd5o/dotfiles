You and me, we're not the same
I am a sinner, you are a saint
When we get to the pearly gates
You'll get the green light
I'll get the old door in the face

Doo, doo, doo
I'm a loser, a disgrace, yeah

I've found love in the strangest place
Tied up and branded, locked in a cage
I say I'm gonna stage a great escape
Let loose and love all
But baby we're out of place

Doo, doo, doo
I'm a loser, a disgrace
You're a beauty
A luminary, in my face

I got it all, and not a lot, I got a lot less than a lot
I've got problems, not just the ones that are little
It's those people problems, it's something to consider
When you come for dinner at my place

I seem to find myself with the craziest of dames
They get the ball on me, I do forget the chains
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Some say strange be a stranger's game
Some go to baseball, some go to base and face
What you can't seem to say

Doo, doo, doo
I'm a loser, a disgrace, yeah
You're a beauty
A luminary in my face

I've got a lot, not a lot, I got a lot less than a lot
I've got problems, not just the ones that are little
It's those people problems, it's something to consider
When you come for dinner at my place

I've got problems, not just the ones that are little
It's those people problems, it's something to consider
When you come for dinner at my, something to consider
When you come for dinner at my place
