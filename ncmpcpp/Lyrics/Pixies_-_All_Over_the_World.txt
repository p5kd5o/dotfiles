with a pet at my side
God in the sky
snow falling down
freeze my body to the ground
i can't ride
but one more time
i will ride
all over the world

washed over the side
top of the sky
slow diver down
two feet land on a different fround
you can't live easily
you can't even speak
but all of them speak
all over the world

i will meet you over there
i am going to meet you over there
washed over the side
top of the sky
slow diver down
two feet land on a different ground
you can't live easily
you can't even speak
fish all of them speak
all over the world

a plain with no herd
not even a bird
when one side is hot
the other side of the moon is not
it's just like a ride
maybe some time
they'll make it a ride
all over the world

i will meet you over there
i am going to meet you over there

time is an arrangement
time is an arranger
i am a derangement

all my thoughts
all i am are my thoughts
all my thoughts
i am all what i'm taught

better call the ranger
got a train derailments
better call the ranger

what i'm taught
all i am are my thoughts
all my thoughts
all i am are my thoughts
what i'm not
