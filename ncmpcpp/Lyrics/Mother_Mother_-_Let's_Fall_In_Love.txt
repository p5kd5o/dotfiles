There's a game in the world, a little bit of cat and mouse
With the boys and the girls, and if I had to ante up
I'd bet on the birds, 'cause they don't have to get caught up
With the boys and the girls and a little game of cat and mouse

Mommy did it, daddy did it
The funny little monkeys in the zoo will do it
The stupid does it, the ugly do it
Only the unlucky of us get to do it
Let's fall in love, let's fall in love.

There's a game in the world, a little bit of cat and mouse
With the boys and the girls, and if I had to ante up
I'd bet on the birds, 'cause they don't have to walk around
With the boys and the girls and a little bit of cat and mouse

Mommy did it, daddy did it
Even though I bet they wish they really didn't
Mary did it, Joey did it
Even little baby baby Jesus did it

Yuppies do it, junkies do it
The funny little monkeys in the zoo will do it
The stupid does it, the foolish do it
Only the unlucky of us get to do it

Let's fall in love.
Let's fall in love.

Mommy did it, daddy did it
The funny little monkeys in the zoo will do it
The stupid does it, the ugly do it
Only the unlucky of us get to do it.
