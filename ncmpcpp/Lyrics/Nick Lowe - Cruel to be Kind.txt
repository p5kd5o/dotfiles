Oh, I can't take another heartache
Though you say you're my friend
I'm at my wits' end
You say your love is bonafide
But that don't coincide
With the things that you do 
And when I ask you to be nice, you say 

You've gotta be cruel to be kind in the right measure
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign
Cruel to be kind means that I love you, baby
(You've gotta be cruel)
You've gotta be cruel to be kind

Well, I do my best to understand, dear
But you still mystify 
And I want to know why
I pick myself up off the ground 
To have you knock me back down
Again and again 
And when I ask you to explain, you say

You've gotta be cruel to be kind in the right measure
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign
Cruel to be kind means that I love you, baby
(You've gotta be cruel)
You've gotta be cruel to be kind

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Well, I do my best to understand, dear
But you still mystify 
And I want to know why
I pick myself up off the ground 
To have you knock me back down
Again and again 
And when I ask you to explain, you say

You've gotta be cruel to be kind in the right measure
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign
Cruel to be kind means that I love you, baby
(You've gotta be cruel)
You've gotta be cruel to be kind

(Cruel to be kind) Oh, in the right measure
(Cruel to be kind) Yeah, it's a very, very, very good sign
(Cruel to be kind) It means that I love you, baby
(You've gotta be cruel)
You've gotta be cruel to be kind

(Cruel to be kind) Oh, in the right measure
(Cruel to be kind) Yes, it's a very, very, very good sign
(Cruel to be kind) It means that I love you, baby
(You've gotta be cruel)
You've gotta be cruel to be kind

(Cruel to be kind) Oh, in the right measure
(Cruel to be kind) Yes, it's a very, very, very good sign
