Don't smoke, don't drink
All I do is think
'Bout the lifelines, hard times
Trying to be kind
It's such a drama, Palaver
Trying to amuse myself
Beats and waves
Will take me to my grave
And when I go there
I know that I won't be alone
'Coz I've been spotted, blotted
Many many times before
Eased and pleased
Released from my shied
I will be flying above
The hatred and the love
And if you see me, Honey
You've had better blink your eyes

Strange how nights blur into one
Bond with me and have some fun
Transcend mind to blow out mind
This is the way to expand the time
Travel comes in many forms
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Wander no more

Walking out of the circle
Step by step I'm learning alone
That I can conquer my demons
Just need to remember my home
There's no need to be frightened
We all already are dead
But yet as unending vibration
Danger lurks only in my head

Come on break trough with me
Such wonders terrify the soul
It's real; no need to question
Knowledge infiltrates the whole

Lighting strikes in the darkest places
Om mane padme hum
Threatened; we have to make choices
Lizards try to tell us which one

Strange how nights blur into one
Bond with me and have some fun
Transcend mind to blow out mine
This is the way to expand the time
Travel comes in many forms
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Wander no more

Don't smoke, don't drink
All I do is think
'Bout the lifelines, hard times
Trying to be kind
It's such a drama palaver
Trying to amuse myself
Beats and waves
Will take me to my grave
And when I go there
I know that I won't be alone
'Coz I've been spotted, blotted
Many many times before
Eased and pleased
Released from my shied
I will be flying above
The hatred and the love
And if you see me, honey
You've had better blink your eyes
