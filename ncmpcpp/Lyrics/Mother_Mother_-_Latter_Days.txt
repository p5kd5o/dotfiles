Look at the guys of the modern day
Gutting the goose with the golden egg
What could it be they are trying to do?
What kind of hell did they put it through?
What kind of hell did it get put through, hey?!

I ain’t coming out today
No I’ma stay in my cave
All because I don’t know how I should behave

In the latter days…

Look at the girl with the modern face
She got lipstick an inch thick and pixelates
What could it be she is trying to say?
What kind of love is she trying to make?
What kind of love would she make to me?

I ain’t coming out today
No I’ma stay in my cave
All because I do not know just what to say

In the latter days…
