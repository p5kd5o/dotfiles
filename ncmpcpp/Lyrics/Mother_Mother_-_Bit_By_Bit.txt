Bit by bit, gonna get my bricks out in the sticks
Bit by bit, gonna build my house in the wildest thickets
Gonna get away from all those mouths and my shit
Gonna say good-bye to all the la-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da

I’m getting on a mountain, away from the people on the ground and
Some cop sticking up my wagon

One by one, I’m gonna get my properties all bundled up
To the branch of a poplar tree and saunter off
With a buck and a wildebeest
I’m getting lost, I’m getting lost, I’m getting lost

I’m getting on a mountain, away from the people on the ground and
Some cop sticking up my wagon
Chop chop we gonna build a cabin, up top on a pretty little mountain
Fuck off all you people on the ground, ya!

No I won’t bring too much of anything
Maybe a little slicker for the rain
Maybe just a good book and a heart to break
I’ll make a mistress of a little Wiccan thing

Bit by bit, gonna get my bricks out in the sticks
Bit by bit, gonna build my house in the wildest thickets
Gonna get away from all those mouths and my shit
Gonna say good bye to all the la-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da

I’m getting on a mountain, away from the people on the ground and
Some cop sticking up my wagon
Chop chop we gonna build a cabin, up top on a pretty little mountain
Fuck off all you people on the ground, ya!
