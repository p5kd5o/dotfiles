[Verse 1]
Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh my little girl

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Verse 2]
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Outro]
Enjoy the silence
