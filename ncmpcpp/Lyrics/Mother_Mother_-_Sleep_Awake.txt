Protecting you
Protecting me
I throw the evidence into a trunk and drop it in the sea

Lie awake
I sleep awake
I sleep with one eye on the bedroom door,
The other on the cake

Protecting me
Protecting you
Carving away our fingerprints out of our fingertips until they're smooth

Lie awake
I sleep awake
I sleep with one eye on my royal flush
The other on the take
I sleep awake

Protecting this
Protecting that
Calling a deadbeat with his dead boat
Wrapped around his artifact
Protecting that

Lie awake
I sleep awake
I sleep with one hand on my 45, the other 'round my baby's waist

Lie awake
I sleep awake
I go to bed with all my lights turned on
So I don't slip away
I stay awake

Out on the street I keep a started car
Who only waits for me, conveniently

Lie awake
I sleep awake
Lie awake
I sleep awake
Ahhh...ahhh...
