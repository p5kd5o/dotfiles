All the remains of a cadaver of days,
I keep hidden away, keep them there just in case.
I wanna visit that place,
blow the dust from the bones
off a body of years that I leave all alone.
Just a body of years,

See the skin disappears
and the blood turns to stone
in a body of years now a pile of bones.
Like a sheet of veneer
each a piece of my soul.
It's a body of years that I leave all alone.

It's Just a body of years, now a pile of bones.
You know.
Old soul who falls down
can't stop trippin' on these
Old roads I go down
get back up and get my foot in the door,
and my face on the page
make my mark in the world
with a bat and a blade.
It's a body of work that you can't ever change
like a body of years that you take to your grave.
It's just a body of years that I leave all alone.
It's just a body of years, now a pile of bones.
Like a sheet of veneer,
Each a piece of my soul.

Old soul who falls down
Can't stop tripping on these
Old roads I go down
Get back up and I'm a
Old soul who falls down
Can't stop tripping on these
Old roads.

It's just a body of years that I leave all alone,
It's just a body of years, now a pile of bones.
Like a sheet of veneer,
Each a piece of my soul.
Like a pile of shit I can't seem to forget.
Just a body of years that I leave all alone.

Tell-tale diary pages
They unveil a ghost from the ages
When bodies of years were breaking from all of the weight
Of diary pages
