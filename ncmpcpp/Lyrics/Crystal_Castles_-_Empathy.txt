premise to interlude
wait til all bones pretrude
you're convexed, you're convert

and make room to begin

down down cities fall down on me

self-controlled consciousness
now it feels omminent
done for your benefit
eat right out of their hand
its concaved all your glands
we're encouraged to forget
preference to be forcefed

down down cities fall down on me

you must earn our empathy
