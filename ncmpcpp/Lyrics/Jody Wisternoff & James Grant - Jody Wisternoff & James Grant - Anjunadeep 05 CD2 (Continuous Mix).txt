[Verse 1: Nadia Ali]
As you came into my life
I knew I would be your wife
The choice I had I couldn't make
When I leave, remember that
I'll be back again
I'll be back again

[Verse 2: Nadia Ali]
Touch of heart
Kiss of faith
Open palms anticipate
Carry me through the haze
When you fall, you're the one
Always on my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Nadial Ali]
All the loss and all the pain
Open arms await

[Chorus 1: Both]
Hold on, baby
I'm almost home
I'm almost home
I'm almost home
I said:
Hold on, baby
I'm almost home
I'm almost home
I'm almost home

[Chorus 2: Nadia Ali]
Will you call for me?
Will you wait and see?
What you mean to me?
I said hold on, love
Will you call for me?
Will you wait and see?
What you mean to me?
I said hold on, hold on
Oh, oh, hold on, hold on
Oh, oh, hold on, hold on
Oh, oh, hold on, hold on

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3: IRO]
As she cries 'till the night
Promises of a life
Familiar voice in my name
Ecoing feel the wait
I'll be back again
I'll be back again

[Verse 4: IRO]
Acts of God like a bear
Song of love, kiss of tear
Free of words, free of mind
I'll go forth by your side
Always on my mind
Always on my mind

[Pre-Chorus: IRO]
All the loss and all the pain
Open arms await

[Chorus 1: Both]
Hold on, baby
I'm almost home
I'm almost home
I'm almost home
You said:
Hold on, baby
I'm almost home
I'm almost home
I'm almost home

[Chorus 2: Nadia Ali]
Will you call for me?
Will you wait and see?
What you mean to me?
I said hold on, love
Will you call for me?
Will you wait and see?
What you mean to me?
I said hold on, hold on
Oh, oh, hold on, hold on
Oh, oh, hold on, hold on
Oh, oh, hold on, hold on
