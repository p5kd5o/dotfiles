Darkness rising
calling out my name
will it be changed
or remain the same?

I have fallen
far from above
landing here
with such a bump!

I have tasted of the fruit
and it's opened up my eyes
It's given me a thirst
that's so hard to satisfy
drink from juicy lips
delicious in a kiss
allow yourself

[x2]

Illuminate me
the time is now!
I know I've been seen
I just can't see how

When I'm hiding
amid the throng
but nowhere is safe
from the ancient song

I have tasted of the fruit
and it's opened up my eyes
It's given me a thirst
that's so hard to satisfy
drink from juicy lips
delicious in a kiss
allow yourself

[x2]

You can bury my heart
it won't stop the beat
under it all
I have dancing feet

Like the gatekeeper knows
I'm weirding one
dazzling spark
from a fallen sun

I have tasted of the fruit
and it's opened up my eyes
It's given me a thirst
that's so hard to satisfy
drink from juicy lips
delicious in a kiss
allow yourself

[x2]

You can bury my heart
it won't stop the beat
under it all
I have dancing feet
