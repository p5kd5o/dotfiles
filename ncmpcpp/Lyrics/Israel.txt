Your eyes like caramel in the sky
Dripping down my moon
Your smile like the wind
I only met you once
But how do I begin?

The Kong Lung market and your flower of life t-shirt
You said you'd fallen and just how much it hurts

So you blew the clouds and you walked around
Asked Pele to take you away from me
A guide pulled a knife and life will suffice
Then fell asleep under the Noni tree

Oh, Anna shared her soup with you
Oh, Anna her eyes were so blue
Oh, Anna can you tell me how he touched you?
Oh, Anna the phoenix on your back rose and flew away

The Kong Lung market and your flower of life t-shirt
(away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away)
Your caramel eyes and signature slight smirk
(away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away)

So you smoked the ice and you dodged the knife
Those kids kept on filming you
You asked to die but you stayed alive
And got lost in Anna's eyes

Oh, Israel, please finish your story
Israel, why won't you just hold me again?
(away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away)
Please finish your story
Israel, why won't you just hold me again?
(away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away)
