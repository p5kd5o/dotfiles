You know I used to be alright,
When you woke me in the morning, waiting for the sun to shine,
And do the two-step all night,
Then you'd spin me round and catch me, laughing as the sun would rise.

Oh I don't know what to do,
You speak a foreign language, what you've put me through,
The enemies, I know you're hiding one or two,
But I just can't say no to you

So I can't let you go
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go
When you won't say.
I can't let you go
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go while
I slip away

Boy it's just a puzzle and the pieces they are scattered on the floor,
It's a silly little game and the sentences are scribbled on the wall,
You think you have the time to wash off all the ugly lies,
But the bottom of the matter is it takes up all your time.
Takes up all your time.

Oh I don't know what to do,
You speak a foreign language, what you've put me through,
The enemies, I know you're hiding one or two,
But I just can't say no to you.

So I can't let you go
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go
When you won't say.
I can't let you go
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go while
I slip away.

Never ending stories lead me to the door,
Then I wait alone just like I did before,
Another mystery is laying down the rhyme,
It seems you are distracted and you'll never have the time.

So I can't let you go
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go
When you won't say
I can't let you go
When you won't let me know
I can't let you go while
I slip away
